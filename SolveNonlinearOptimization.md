## opt++ a useful opensource tool for optimization problem

> [OPT++](https://software.sandia.gov/opt++/) is a C++ library of nonlinear optimization algorithms.

Recently, I have been struggling solving an nonlinear optimization problem, and I have found a useful tool for this problem. And OPT++, AMPL are both good choices for solving optimization problems. AMPL is also easy, but it is commercial and expensive while OPT++ is open source.
